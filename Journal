using g4ad.xlarge instance in EC2
That failed. Using a free isntance of unknown kind now

Downloaded miniconda
Downloaded github repository
changed directory to repository
conda create -n ai_scientist python=3.11
conda activate ai_scientist
sudo yum install texlive *Note this is different from the instructions
sudo yum install git
git clone https://github.com/SakanaAI/AI-Scientist.git
cd AI-Scientist
pip install -r requirements.txt
///***CRASH***\\\ Out of memeory

Google colab
!pip install openai
!apt-get install git
!git clone https://github.com/SakanaAI/AI-Scientist.git
apt-get install texlive-full -y (Do this in colab terminal)
cd AI-Scientist
pip install -r requirements.txt
Restart runtime
from google.colab import userdata
userdata.get('ANTHROPIC_API_KEY')
!pip install google-cloud-aiplatform
!pip install anthropic[vertex]
Discovered that the terminal and the google colab cells don't always have the same directory.
I will need to figure out how to run the program without using the terminal. 
BUT apt-get install texlive-full -y command requires interaction which can only be done in the terminal. 
Perhaps I need to try to figure out how google cloud works.
