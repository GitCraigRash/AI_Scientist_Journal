AI_SCIENTIST_JOURNAL

Used for recording my journey in getting the AI scientist to work on AI alignment problems.

API Gateway REST API
We are going to  need the Amazon API Gateway REST API because it will allow us to tell the AI_SCIENTIST what to research.
It will allow the AI_SCIENTIST to read from the internet Opensourse Scientific papers. 
It will allow the AI_Scientist to use Amazon Bedrock for inference.
talk to Amazon Dynamic BD to randomly search it's previous work.
Amazon Simple Storage Services to store photos and our initial files.

We are not going to use AMAZON API Gateway Websocket because its unnecessary. I want to get this first version out soon.

We will use AWS Lambda to communicate with the AmazonS3 and AWS REST API, Amz Bedrock, Amz DyamicsBD
