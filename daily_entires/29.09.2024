1. Goal
  To define how much freedom the AI - Scientist has to change the experument set up and to give it as much as necessary for its creativity to be meaningful.

2. Thoughts behind goal
  By now ing what elements the Scientist had control over, I can more reliably produce the papers. 
3. Proposed processes
  List items the AI Scientist had access to in the example build and implement them in my own build. 

4. Actions taken
   Item found: 
    The parameters and meta-parameters model itself. 
    The ability to add noise to the datasets.
    The optimizer parameters
    The progress bar.
    The ability to change the code that records the results.
    it can change the commands that set the parameters to the experement.py calls.

  Now I need to see how I can get the Scientist to chage the aprameters for dolphin Llama 3

  7:43am
  Working on adapting experement.py to download dolphin Llama3, set it's parameters, run experement, then call Llama3 API

  8:08am
    Found several parameters for the Scientist to alter. Now working on adding the code to download the model, tokenizer and the code to run the API
