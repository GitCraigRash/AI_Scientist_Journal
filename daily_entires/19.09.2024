I want to try to use AWS to do the program because it seems like google colab's file system is incompatable with the ai_scientist. 

When launching an AWS instance, It says that I  do not have permission to launch a g type instance with more than zero CPU. So I submitted a request for more. Switching back to getting colab to work.
