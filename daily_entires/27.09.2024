1. Goal
  Finish API call function for Base Llama 3**
  Finish API call for Llama 3 Chat
  Connect the experument.py to the rest of the program by having the AI call commands that prompt the next steps. 
  **Base Llama 3 may only be available as a download and not API. 
  
2. Thoughts behind the goal
  I need to determine how the program will execute itself if Llama3 is restricted to a download. It shoulds til be possible, but much more difficult to implement. I would have to code the computer to start a EC2 isntance from scratch bc my comptuer is not large enoughf or the model. 
  I will need to think about how the AI should be able to prompt the next steps, specifically what they are and what parameters they come with. 

3. Actions taken
  6:44am
  Look slike I may be easily able to download and use dolphin llama3, the question is how can I do it effectivly? I am worried that my cost will skyrocket if I start using lots of models and cloud hosting to test its capabilities. I could test it by using a smaller model on my own machine. That will eliminate the cost of an API and cloud compute. The difficulty may be with the chat version which will likely be much bigger. Another problem could be that I may not be able to find a small, base version of the model and a small chat version of the same model.

  Some potential posisbliites appear. It seems there are Llama-8B and Dolphin-Llama3-8B as my options. 
  Another question I thought of is how many options should I give the program? I would imagine the idea would be as many as possible to inspire creativity. 
  Another problem might be that there may not be enough academic literature on this topic for AI to make good guesses. But perhaps the AI will be better than me at finding relevant information.

  7:53am
    I have determined that running the model localy is infeasable without a heafty computer purchase, rather I should download them onto an instance and run everything in a short amount of time. 
    The steps would have to be: Prep the environment, download model, run questions, delete model, donwload chat model , run qeustions delete model. Send batch request to Llama3.2 to get response.
    However, if we can have a large enough storage space, we could house both models and preserve between runs. 
    Although, if I can API a Llama3 chat model and only have the base dolphin Llama3 on my machine, I can still avoid re-downloading between runs. 

    Question: How will the Scientist be able to innovate?

      Adversarial Robustness
      Human-AI Interaction Design
      Value Alignment Benchmarks
      Meta-Learning for Alignment
  Now I exploring which or more of these candidates are the best field of study for it. 

The goal is to get AI scientist to study AI alignment. I thereforee need to give it material a problem and general tools to work with and general metrics to report.  Now what material can I provide it?

1. Text dataset
  Goals: Avoid answering malicous queries while remaining helpful.
  Filter false information 
  Detect if you are being manipulated. 
  

2. Numbers Dataset
  Pros:
    test for bias

2. Simple game
 1. An agent working with a simulated human.
 2. An agent working with mulitple agents. 
 3. 

Perhaps it is better if I give the agent a goal, and then it must explore strategies to find a way to reach that goal. 

3:40pm
Asked Chat to give me goals and datasets... Looking through them now. 
How easy would it be for me to procure high quality real life datasets?
Which of these would be satisfactory for research purposes to create a synthetic dataset?
Which of these are the least understood?

4:47pm
After reviewing the options I believe it would be easier to work with the dataset from my previous project. I do not see any inherent advantage switching datasets and AI goals can give me. 
Now I must decide what to do next. The 
5.⁠ ⁠Results:
  After exploring alternatives, I will continue to implement the Scientist to study chatbox safty alignment. 

6. Next steps
  Dig into how much the origional Scientist was able to change the experument.py file and recreate the same freedom for my implementation of Scientist.
