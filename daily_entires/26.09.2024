1. Goal:
  To produce Latex Paper by repeatedly using generate_markup.py on paper
  To set up AI-Scientist to perfrom Alignment.
    Add functions to format data
    Add functions to call API's. Specifically, Llama3.2 where approrpate.
  Answer question : In what way will AI be able to adjust the parameters of the project?

2. Thought Behind the Goal:
  The program needs responses from it's tests in order to get results from it's modifications. 
  By having a hypothosis of the AI's behavior, I can more easily falsify my understanding of the program. 
  

3. Proposed Process:
  Modify the code from my previous project to run on this program.

4. Actions Taken:
  7:20am
    Set up. Opening aascientist and Functions.ipynb to transfer and modify functions.
    Spent most of the time asking Chat if there was any way to increase efficiencey fo my process.
  7:40am
    Reading about Llama3.2 #Self note: fine-tuning (SFT), rejection sampling (RS), and direct preference optimization (DPO).

  5:00pm
Look for base Llama model. Found that the dolphin-Llama model is unalingned and can be used as a starting base. 

5. Results:
  
6. Next Steps:
