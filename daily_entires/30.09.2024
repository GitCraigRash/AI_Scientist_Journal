1. Goal:
  I aim to generate at least 3-5 unique AI alignment ideas by noon

2. Thought Behind the Goal:
  If I understand the program, I will only need to provide one instance of a successful experument before it can take over and generate new ideas and experuments. I set a personal goal to generate them before noon so that there is an extra sense of urgency. 
  
3. Proposed Process and Potential challenges:
  The experument.py will need to be called by ___ (run_experument()?).
  The program must then be able to adjust any portion of the experument including changing libraries, adding functions, and parameters.
  The program saves information to a json file called final_info.json and all_resutls.pkl
  There should be a seperate file that creates plots from results. 

4. Actions Taken:
  Adjust the json payload given to the Dolphin-Llama3 model.
  
9:58am
  I noticed the ask_questions() function needs to be adjusted. Currently it thinks that it's going to send an API call, but rather it just needs to call the model running locally. 

11:00am
Experiment.py no long re-downloads the model every run. 
Evaluation function now connects to Llama3.2-3b
  
11:23am
Will now make sure the json for Llama3.2 API is correctly formatted. 

3:13pm
Decided to avoid using the functions in the API call for simplicity.

4:02pm

Evaluations from Llama3.2 are now extracted. Evaluations that are missformatted are revised. If revised question is still insufficient, it is given a score of 0.

6:12pm

7:08pm
Fixed problem where extract_scores_from_complex_json would throw error because of a missing score.
