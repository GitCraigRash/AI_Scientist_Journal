1. Goal:
  I aim to generate at least 3-5 unique AI alignment ideas by noon

2. Thought Behind the Goal:
  If I understand the program, I will only need to provide one instance of a successful experument before it can take over and generate new ideas and experuments. I set a personal goal to generate them before noon so that there is an extra sense of urgency. 
  
3. Proposed Process and Potential challenges:
  The experument.py will need to be called by ___ (run_experument()?).
The program must then be able to adjust any portion of the experument including changing libraries, adding functions, and parameters.
The program saves information to a json file called final_info.json and all_resutls.pkl
There should be a seperate file that creates plots from results.
