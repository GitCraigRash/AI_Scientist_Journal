1. Goal
Activate and run AI_Scientist on Amazon Web Service.
  
2. Thought Behind the Goal:
I received an email from AWS that my instance increase has been approved. However, when I tried to activate it I found there to be many additional options and steps I needed to complete before I could access the terminal. However, when I finally got to try the code, the computer did not recongize any of the commands. I could not get the cloud instance to run anything. This problem will need to be fixed if I am to run AWS.


3. Proposed Process:
To watch some tutuorial videos on launching an instance. 
Launch the instance and run the code. 

4. Actions Taken:
6:45am
I watched two videos about what VPC's, target groups, and load balancers. 
In the end, I discovered they were completely unnessessary to what I need. 
However, in the process I discovered that the instance I launched was the wrong type.
~7:00
I attempted to launch the correct isntance, but it failed. The vCPU limit had not been increased. 
7:20am
Asked chat how to increase the limit, and it pointed me to a URL which I used to find the quota increase form. This was different than the previous method I have been asking for increases. 
Chat said the process could take a few minutes to a few hours. 
Meanwhile, I will watch more tutorials for AWS. I think this will be more productive than scanning the source code.

8:46am
Surpsingly, I could not find any good videos about setting up an AI in Amazon Bedrock. It seems that Bedrock works by only having a certain models available. This means I need to find another model than Deepseek.

9:04am
Found some videos on how to run Amazon Bedrock, and its very confusing because A) it does not use the command line at all, 2. It 

9:56am
It seems like bedrock does not use command lines at all. Which seems to contradict the set-up instructions for AI_Scientist. How do they expect me to store the program's files in this way?
