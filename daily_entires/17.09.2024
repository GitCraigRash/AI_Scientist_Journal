1. Goal:
To use a virutal machine to run AI_scientist locally.
  
2. Thought Behind the Goal:
[Explain why this goal is important, how it aligns with larger objectives, and what you hope to achieve]
This will likely eliminate roadblocks to generating papers because the developers provided explicit instructions. This speed will help me implement the ai_scientist faster. 
It will also reduce cost because I would be using my machine instead of google colab compute time. 


3. Proposed Process:
Ask ChatGTP how to intall. 
Do it. 

4. Actions Taken:
After asking Chat, it says to use VirtualBox to download and install Linix.

Found a website with instructions: https://medium.com/@thehippieandtheboss/how-to-create-a-linux-virtual-machine-on-macos-1278ec1ef327
Problem: downloaded the extension pack isntead of the vitual box platform. 

Download successful, checking which type of linux I need for the project...
Encoutered an error when launching linux system: [ 24.46943] vmugfx 0000:00:02.0: [drm] *ERROR* vmug seems to be running on an unsupported hypervisor. [21.475968] vmugfx 0000:00:02.0 [drm] *ERROR* this configuration is likely broken. [ 23.988796] vmugfx 0000:00:02.0 [drm] *ERROR* Please switch to a supported graphics device to avoid problems.

10:05am
Chat says this could that Linux is trying to inappropriatly access the graphics card. 
"Specifically, the vmwgfx error message is related to VMware's graphics drivers, which Ubuntu might be trying to use inappropriately inside VirtualBox."
It then suggested several options to fix the problem. I will start with Switch to a Different Graphics Controller.

10:12am
Linux randomly started working. ????
However, the insructions I was following do no display this screen. Ubuntu also cannot find the internet.
10:30am
After fiddling for a bit, it seemed wifi was unnecessary? Perhaps it connects to the host computer? Problem done. 

10:32am
Download seems to have slowed or stopped. I will wait a bit longer...
10:40am
Determined Ubuntu was frozen. Restarting Virtual Machine now...
11:02am
Update. Loading has proceeded further than before...
11:21am
Appears to have frozen much later in the downloading process. Investigating to see if it needs more memory space...
11:35am
Looked the problem up on overstack and found advice to use "safe graphics" installation installation mode. trying now.
12:09am
The download progressed further, but unfortunatly froze again...
Added memomory and video memory.
1:20pm
Ubuntu finally downloaded.

5:54pm
Starting to use the Ubuntu operating system with Virtual box. It's painfully slow and does not seem to be able to copy and paste. 
I allocated more cores and video RAM to Ubuntu. It seem to work moderately better.

7:03pm
The copy paste commands are unresponsive dispite looking up various ways to operate them. I am typing things manually.
Installing miniconda so that there is a isolated instance the creators require. Now proceeding to test local install. 
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
HTTP request sent, awaiting reponse ... 404 Not Found

7:18PM
Semantic Scolar answerd my API request. Testing in Google Colab to see if papers can be generated. 
Switched back to google colab to see if the APi works. 
Unfortunatly results are mostly the same, but there are new messages saying if the idea was found novel or not. 
I am going to modify the code to wait more than one second before searching again. 

8:14PM
The program sucessfully checks if the papers are on semantic scholar! but now it's failing because it cannot find a specific file. 
"""Processing idea: controllable_generation
Failed to evaluate idea controllable_generation: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'templates/2d_diffusion/run_0/final_info.json'
All ideas evaluated."""
The code is asking: """assert not osp.exists(folder_name), f"Folder {folder_name} already exists." """
But instead of creating the file, the program goes simply says failed to evaluate. Implying that the final_results.json should already exist. 

9:10pm
Been looking into how to change the code so that the program detects Colab is being used and uses the proper commands to create a new file. 


5. Results:
With the Semantic Scholar API secure, I am further than I have been before. The program generates ideas and evaluates there novalty. Sadly it cannot document the final results.  The current obstical is how the program tries to create new directories and files in a way not supported by Google colab. My instinct is to modify the code to support Colab, but a cleaner solution may be to use Amazon Bedrock. The local alternative, using Ubuntu on a Virtual box on my machine, is computationally taxing on my Macbook Air and on my sainity(no copy/paste). I am further conserned that the instructions require NVIDEA graphics cards which my Macbook does not have.   

6. Next Steps:
I hope to 1. Request Amazon AWS for access to more CPUs 2. Testing if modifying the source code will yeild results on Colab.
